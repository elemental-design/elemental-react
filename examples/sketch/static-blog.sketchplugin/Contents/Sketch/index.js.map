As specified in the\n    OpenType specification, feature tags contain four ASCII characters.\n\n    Tag strings longer or shorter than four characters,\n    or containing characters outside the U+20–7E codepoint range are invalid.\n\n    Feature tags need only match a feature tag defined in the font,\n    so they are not limited to explicitly registered OpenType features.\n\n    Fonts defining custom feature tags should follow the tag name rules\n    defined in the OpenType specification [OPENTYPE-FEATURES].\n\n    Feature tags not present in the font are ignored;\n    a user agent must not attempt to synthesize fallback behavior based on these feature tags.\n\n    The one exception is that user agents may synthetically support the kern feature with fonts\n    that contain kerning data in the form of a ‘kern’ table but lack kern feature\n    support in the ‘GPOS’ table.\n\n    In general, authors should use the ‘font-kerning’ property to explicitly\n    enable or disable kerning\n    since this property always affects fonts with either type of kerning data.\n\n    If present, a value indicates an index used for glyph selection.\n\n    An <integer> value must be 0 or greater.\n\n    A value of 0 indicates that the feature is disabled.\n\n    For boolean features, a value of 1 enables the feature.\n\n    For non-boolean features, a value of 1 or greater enables the\n    feature and indicates the feature selection index.\n\n    A value of ‘on’ is synonymous with 1 and ‘off’ is synonymous with 0.\n\n    If the value is omitted, a value of 1 is assumed.\n\n    font-feature-settings: \"dlig\" 1;       /* dlig=1 enable discretionary ligatures * /\n    font-feature-settings: \"smcp\" on;      /* smcp=1 enable small caps * /\n    font-feature-settings: 'c2sc';         /* c2sc=1 enable caps to small caps * /\n    font-feature-settings: \"liga\" off;     /* liga=0 no common ligatures * /\n    font-feature-settings: \"tnum\", 'hist'; /* tnum=1, hist=1 enable tabular numbers\n                                              and historical forms * /\n    font-feature-settings: \"tnum\" \"hist\";  /* invalid, need a comma-delimited list * /\n    font-feature-settings: \"silly\" off;    /* invalid, tag too long * /\n    font-feature-settings: \"PKRN\";         /* PKRN=1 enable custom feature * /\n    font-feature-settings: dlig;           /* invalid, tag must be a string * /\n\n    When values greater than the range supported by the font are specified,\n    the behavior is explicitly undefined.\n\n    For boolean features, in general these will enable the feature.\n\n    For non-boolean features, out of range values will in general be equivalent to a 0 value.\n\n    However, in both cases the exact behavior will depend upon the way the font is designed\n    (specifically, which type of lookup is used to define the feature).\n\n    Although specifically defined for OpenType feature tags,\n    feature tags for other modern font formats that support font features\n    may be added in the future.\n\n    Where possible, features defined for other font formats\n    should attempt to follow the pattern of registered OpenType tags.\n\n    The Japanese text below will be rendered with half-width kana characters:\n\n    body { font-feature-settings: \"hwid\";

# Line, shape, form, texture and balance

Abstraction for app presentation to speed up cross-platform UI design and development with code using React/Sketch as a design function.

Build UI components once, render to any platform using `react-primitives`. This library abstracts away common UI patterns for you.


## TODO: Clean up these notes:

## Line
Themed colour (primary)
- Weight
- Color
- Texture
- Style


## Shape
Foundational element.
- Depth
  - Light, shadow and depth (illusion)

## Texture
Physical quality of a surface.

## Balance
Equal distribution of visual weight – spacing.
- Symmetry (each side is the same)
- Asymmetry – evenly distribute weight
- Rule of thirds – grid divided into thirds
